## Why Quickfix AI? ü§î

Traditional web search tools like Google Chrome Find tool lack the ability to understand the semantic nature of words and fail to provide precise results when it comes to searching for information on web pages. Existing tools only search based on keywords, limiting their effectiveness. I need a more advanced solution to quickly obtain relevant information from web pages I'm currently browsing. Therefore, I developed the Quickfix AI chrome extension, which utilizes GPT technology to enable users to ask questions and get accurate, human-like responses about the webpage they are on. This extension aims to provide a more efficient and effective way of searching for information on web pages.

Now let's get started!

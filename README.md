## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Quickfix AI uses GPT and Vector Index to provide instant answers on large resources of text. Two key features which makes it unique from other Gen AI tools like ChatGPT:
- No input limit [^1]
- Precise answers [^2]

Quickfix AI has two products for quick and easy access of answers where you need it:
- [VS Code Extension](vscode-extension/README.md)
- [Chrome Extension](chrome-extension/README.md)

According to your use case, read individual product's Readme to learn more about Quickfix AI.

[^1]: GPT is limited to 4k tokens in input size. Quickfix AI uses Vector Index to process almost any size of input
[^2]: ChatGPT provides answers based on knowledge about the whole internet. Quickfix AI just uses current data whether it's the webpage you are browsing or your source code to provide answers which are more personalized than ChatGPT
